Restormer Architecture

The architecture was directly imported from the official Restormer GitHub repository:

> [`restormer_arch.py`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swz30/Restormer/main/basicsr/models/archs/restormer_arch.py)

- This script defines the full Restormer model used as the **teacher** in our project.
- No modifications were made to the original architecture.
- Ensure it is available in your working directory or accessible through your Python path before training or inference.

  Pretrained Weights

The pretrained weights for the Restormer model were downloaded from Google Drive:

> [Google Drive Link for Weights](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bRBG8DG_72AGA6-eRePvChlT5ZO4cwJ4)

- These weights were used to initialize the Restormer model.
- Make sure to place them in the appropriate location.
